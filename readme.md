The simple easy to use bot that provides a wide range of entertainment and utility for your server.

### JDBot is always being updated, with many new and useful features coming *in the future*

#### Any Questions about JDBot?

DM `JDJG Inc. Official#3993`!

##### Copyright concerns, including the use of this code

This bot's source code is public so that the people can see how this bot works.
If you were to fork the bot, DO give credit to @JDJGInc and use this responsibly.
Also, if you want to copy the bot's code and run your own instance of JDBot, *do* DM `JDJG Inc. Official#3493` on Discord.
If you plan to copy anything please let me know on discord or in an issue(this helps keep track of those who use my code, and so I can help you if you need help, please make your own code though.)
If you do copy any code make sure to make a good faith effort to change the code to your own style, that way it's not weird for word. I don't want you to copy every feature I have one for one, if you do want to do this, you can just host your own instance

(make sure to ask me how you can do that, or I can do that for you if you want.)

Though, I would rather you use my bot or make a pull request if you have changes or make an issue, you can just ask, if I deny your request, please understand I have my own reason for denying the change. If you would like to protest please do so in a civil manner.

My Bot also uses a subclassed Bot(if you don't program in discord.py or anyone of the forks, it's not important it just means one session bot wise to be able to do powerful functions without requiring many aiohttp sessions.)

You can just DM me on Discord, and I will hook up your webhook to my github, so you will get updates too :D

If you Host your own instance, and call it your own orginal code.
I will take it down.
You Have Been Warned.
Now, if you got permission from me first, then you are fine but It must be done in a public way, I have the right to revoke this.

Thank You,
JDJG
