probably smoking crack.","if the world is round, let's go this way to india.","nah, don't worry, we already got this, said portugal.","so chris goes to spain.","hey spain, wanna hire me to find india by going around back of the world?","no.","please?","no.","please?","no.","please?","ok.","so he sails into the ocean.","and discovers more ocean.","and then discovers the indies.","and japan.","let's

christians!","do you sin?","now you can buy your way out of hell.","that's bullshit.","this whole thing is bullshit.","that's a scam.","fuck the church.","here's 95 reasons why, said martin luther, in his new book, which might have accidentally started the protestant reformation.","you know what would be magnificent, said suleiman, wearing an onion hat?","what if the ottoman empire was really big?","which it is now.","what if russia was big? said ivan, trying not to be terrible.","portugal had a dream that they controlled the entire indian ocean, including the spice trade.","and then that dream was real.","and spain realized that this is not india, but they pillaged it anyway.","damn, said england and france.","we gotta start pillaging some stuff.","then the dutch revolt and all the hipsters move to amsterdam.","damn, said amsterdam.","we gotta start pillaging some stuff.","question 1: can you get to india through north america?","no, but at least there's beaver.","question 2: steal the spice trade.","that's not a question, but the dutch did it anyway.","**sugar**","guess where all the sugar's made?","in brazil.","*stolen*","and the caribbean.","and it's so god damn profitable you might forget to not do slavery.","the next thing on russia's to-do list is to get bigger.","britain and france are having a friendly discussion about who should control the entire world.","more specifically, ohio.","then it escalates into a seven year discussion, giving prussia a chance to show austria who's boss.","but what about britain and france, did they figure out who's boss?","yes they did.","it's britain.","guess who's broke?","also britain.","so they start taxing the hell out of america.","fuck you, says america, declaring their independence, and fighting for it.","and france helps them win, now france is broke.","and britain'll have to send their prisoners to a different continent.","wait, if france is broke, why do the king and queen still wear such fancy dresses?","let's overthrow the palace and cut all their heads off! said robespierre, cutting everybody's head off until someone eventually got mad and cut his head off.","you could make a reli- no, don't.","haiti is staring to like the idea of a revolution.","especially the slaves, who free themselves by killing their masters.","why didn't we think of this before?","wait, who's in charge of france now?","**me**","said napoleon, trying to take over europe.","luckily, they banished him to an island.","**but he came back**","luckily, they banished him to another island.","there goes latin america, becoming independent in the latin american wars of independence.","britain just figured out how to turn steam into power.","so now they can make","**many different types of machines and factories with machines in them so they can make a lot of products real fast**","then they invent some trains.","and conquer india and maybe put some trains there.","hey, china! said britain.","buy stuff from us!","nah dude, we already got everything, says china.","so britain tried to get them addicted to opium.","which worked, actually.","but then china made it illegal and dumped it all into the sea.","so britain threw a hissy fit, and made them open up five cities and give them an island.","britain and russia are playing a game where they try to stop each other from conquering afghanistan.","also, the","**sultan of oman lives in zanzibar now**","\"that's just where he lives\"","india just had a revolution, and they would like to govern themselves now.","nope, said britain, governing them even harder than before.","**technology is about to go crazy**","the united states finally figured out whether slavery is good or bad.","it's bad, they decided.","and then they continued manifesting their destiny, which is to kill the rest of the natives and take their land and maybe kick out the mexicans too.","i know, let's rape africa, said europe, scrambling to see who could rape it the fastest.","^^they ^^never ^^got ^^ethiopia","britain and france are still hungry.","^^they ^^never ^^got ^^thailand","the united states ran out of destiny to manifest, so they're looking for more.","**hawaii**","**cuba**","wait, spain controls cuba.","well, blame something on them and go to war!","what should we blame on spain?","let's blame the maine on spain.","so they blame the maine on spain.","now we're in business.","to celebrate, they kick panama out of panama and make a canal, connecting the two oceans.","britain just found oil in the middle east.","^^it ^^makes ^^cars ^^go","china is so tired of being bossed around that they delete their old government and make a new, stronger government, which is accidentally weaker and controlled by a guy from the previous government.","europe hasn't had a war since the last war.","so they start world war 1.","look at those guns.","it's gonna be a great war.","so great we won't need a second one.","after it's over, they blame germany.","russia went on strike and the workers overthrew the government.","now everyone's paycheck is the same.","**communism**","**in the soviet union**","the arabs revolt and britain helps.","now the ottoman empire's gone so we can give the","**jewish people a place to live**","hopefully the arabs won't mind.","let's cut the cake, said sykes and picot, carving up the remains of the not-so-ottoman-anymore empire.","**except turkey, turkey makes a brand new turkey**","and then the saudis conquer arabia.","it just seemed like the right thing to do.","hello?","yes, it's the 1920's calling.","let's get in the car and drive to a party and listen to jazz on the radio and go to the movies.","the economy's great and it'll probably be great forever, just kidding.","germany's back, featuring hitler, the angry mustache model.","and he's mad at the jews for existing.","japan is finally conquering the east, and they're so excited they rape nanking way too hard.","they should probably just deny it.","hitler's out of control.","so the international community tackles him and then tries to explain why killing all the jews is a bad idea.","but he kills himself before they

pakistans.","one of them can be bangladesh later.","the jews and the arabs finally figured out which one of them should live in the holy land.","me, they both said at the same time.","let's divide up the land so everyone's happy.","**sike, they both get angrier**","look out china, there's a new china in china.","what's on the menu?","communism!","no thanks, said the other china, escaping to an island.","i wonder which one is the real china?","there's the korean war, korea versus korea.","nobody wins, then it's on pause forever.","let's meet the sponsors.","oh, it's the two global
